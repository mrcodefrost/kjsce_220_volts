## Crash Assistance & Rescue System
This is a Hardware and Software integrated project that stresses on providing post rash assistance to the passengers of a vehicle. The hardware part consists of a Bluetooth module, along with the microcontroller that is connected to the impact sensors of the vehicle, which is paired with the mobile phone of the passenger. As soon as the sensors detect a collision and the airbags are deployed, the flutter app installed on the user's mobile receives a signal from the bluetooth and automatically sends the user data and the user's current location to the user's closed ones and the emergency services.
